1. let the login page show up first //done
2. add logged in variable for security //added (haven't implemented security yet)
3. add (add contact method) send the other user a request. // i think it's done
4. respond (accept/reject) allows the other user to respond. // i think it's done can't remember
5. private messaging with contacts // ooohhh daaaammmn son


use this instead of adding the onclick attribute(this works apparently)
elt.onclick = function(){} // native javascript
$('#id').click( () => {}) // JQuery click function
elt.addEventListener('click', () => {} ) // adding an event listener

PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS	
	problem:
	-i wasn't able to add an onclick event directly to the new html i wanted to dynamically add
	solution
	-> i had to (in the loop) add that specific html to the document used the jquery click to assign a
	click function and that fixed it
